Hi, I'm Richard.

I [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardlaugesen/) at the Bureau of Meteorology as a hydro-data scientist, and am a PhD candidate at the University of Adelaide [researching](/research) the value of forecasts for water-sensitive decisions. 

For fun I play guitar & learn piano, and I prefer fixing things over buying them. I live in Australia, was born in New Zealand, and have a rare bleeding disorder called [Haemophilia](https://www.haemophilia.org.au/about-bleeding-disorders/fast-facts). I occasionally share general thoughts and opinions [here](/writing). 

You can connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/richardlaugesen) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardlaugesen/).
