The [Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Deep_Space_Communication_Complex) will be the first place on Earth to receive the data from [Cassini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens) as it crashes into Saturn in a few days. We live half an hour away, and so my 5 year old daughter and I are very excited!

But unfortunately it is closed.

So what to do? Here are a few links to track things online:

I remember when Cassini launched in 1997 and when Huygens landed on Titan in 2005. Space exploration is a long game but I love it. The technology is reliable and the science just mind blowing. It's amazing considering the spacecraft was built over 20 years ago.
